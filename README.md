CS 255 Module Eight Journal: DriverPass System Design Reflection

1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project.
The DriverPass project involved working with a fictional client named DriverPass, a
company that helps students prepare for their driver’s license exams. The client requested a
web-based system that would allow customers to register, schedule, and cancel driving
lessons, access study materials, and communicate with instructors and admins. The goal
was to streamline their operations through an intuitive online platform.

2. What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did particularly well with the system modeling and diagram creation. The UML
diagrams—especially the activity and sequence diagrams—were clearly structured and
accurately reflected the system’s workflow. I also ensured that the technical requirements
were well thought out and tailored to meet the client’s specific needs.

3. If you could revise one part of your work, what would it be?
If I could revise one part of the project, I would refine the formatting of the business
requirements document to make it even more professional. I would add a clearer table of
contents, polish the section headers, and enhance readability for both technical and non-
technical audiences.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them?
I carefully reviewed the DriverPass interview transcript and translated their needs into
specific system functions and requirements. Features like password recovery, role-based
access, and online scheduling were all designed with user experience in mind. Considering
the user’s needs is essential because it ensures the system is intuitive, functional, and solves
real-world problems.

5. How do you approach designing software?
I approach software design by first gathering and analyzing user requirements, then
creating visual models like UML diagrams to map out functionality. In the future, I plan to
use iterative design methods, user feedback loops, and tools like Lucidchart and GitHub to
maintain organization and version control. Thorough documentation and collaboration will
also be key parts of my design process.
